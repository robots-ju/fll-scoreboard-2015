# Unofficial FLL 2015 Scoreboard

Web scoreboard for the FLL 2015 (Trash Trek) Robot Game.

## Images copyrights

The table overview image and the Trash Trek logo come from the official [Robot Game materials](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge/2015trashtrek).
Table image was edited to have white background around the table.
Logo image was scaled down to a more practical size and weight (I still don't know how the original 219x186 jpeg in so bad quality can weight > 600ko).
